# Docker Inject
Copy files/directories from hosts to running Docker containers.

## Description

## Requirement

* [Docker 1.3+](https://www.docker.com/)
* [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/) (for Mac OS X and Windows)

## Installation

Download the appropriate zip package for your system.

* [Linux (64bit)](https://github.com/y-taka-23/docker-inject/releases/download/v0.1.0/docker-inject_0.1.0_linux_amd64.zip)
* [Mac OS X (64bit)](https://github.com/y-taka-23/docker-inject/releases/download/v0.1.0/docker-inject_0.1.0_darwin_amd64.zip)

After downloading, unzip the package and copy the `docker-inject` binary
to somewhere on the `PATH` so that it can be executed.

Incidentally, `docker-inject` is written in Go,
thus you can build the latest version from the source by:

```
$ go get https://github.com/y-taka-23/docker-inject
```
